# Machinery Fleet Management System

This is a C language project developed for the *Advanced Procedural Programming* module at ATU Galway.  
The application helps manage a fleet of machinery using a password-protected interface and a linked list database.

## Features

- **Login system** with hidden password input (reads from `login.txt`)
- **Linked list** used to store machinery data
- **Load and save** machine data from/to `fleet.txt`
- **Menu options** include:
  1. Add a new machine
  2. Display all machines
  3. Display a specific machine (by chassis number)
  4. Update a machineâ€™s details
  5. Delete a machine
  6. Generate a report (`report.txt`) with all machines
- All data is **saved automatically** on exit
- Code is modular and commented in English
